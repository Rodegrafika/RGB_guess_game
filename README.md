# RGB_guess_game
This is a simple RGB guessing game, made with Vanilla JavaScript and styled with CSS.

I made it during an online Web Developer Bootcamp with Colt Steele (Developer and Bootcamp Instructor) https://github.com/Colt
I also made some changes from the original project in style and features.
Feel free to contact me if you have any tip or question.

Have a nice code-day everyone.
